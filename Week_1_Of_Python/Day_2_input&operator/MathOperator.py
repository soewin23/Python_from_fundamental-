#  Arithmetic Operators

x = 10
y = 2

print(x + y) # plus operator
print(x - y) # minus
print(x * y) # multiplicaation operator
print(x / y) # Division operator
print(x % y) # for knowing remainder
print(x ** y) # Exponentioation operator
print(x // y) # Floor division



#  "=" == Assignment Operator

name = "Soe Win"# We assign Soe win in mane using "="

# +=

a = 5 
b = 3
sum = a+ b #or
print(sum)

s = 10   # 0r      s  =s + 12
s+= 12
print(s)


#   -=
s = 10   #  or     s  = s-2
s-= 2
print(s)

#   *=
s = 10   #  or     s  = s*2
s*= 2
print(s)

#  /=
s = 10   #  or     s  = s/2
s /= 2
print(s)

# %= 

s = 10   #  or     s  = s%2
s%= 2
print(s)


#//= 

s = 10   #  or     s  = s//2
s //= 2
print(s)

# **= 

s = 10   #  or     s  = s**2
s **= 2
print(s)


x = 3
print(x)
# 0r
print(x:=3)
